\section*{\centering Abstract}
UMM introductory CS curriculum emphasizes problem solving and general approaches to programming, such as modularity. Languages in the Lisp family, such as Racket, fit well with this emphasis. Currently, the language Racket is being used in an introductory course at UMM and has beneficial aspects for teaching functional approaches for CS design and a robust graphical library. However, Racket is primarily used as a teaching language and is not often used outside of the classroom setting. In contrast, Clojure, a novel language in the Lisp family, is used more often in real world settings and provides better parallel processing and integration with other languages. Therefore, using Clojure in an introductory class would be potentially more beneficial for students. The focus of our project is developing a graphical library in Clojure for introductory-level students. This is a part of a larger ongoing project to integrate Clojure into a college-level introductory CS course.

Since functional languages focus on functions as programming units, provide abstraction, generalization, modularity, and give a better understanding of recursion (one of the key learning goals in an introductory CS course), we feel it is important that the graphical library used by students implements these functional approaches and is consistent with the functional programming in Clojure. In order to accomplish our goal, we want to create a graphical library that is similar to the one in Racket because it teaches introductory students problem solving skills and modularity with functional approaches in an engaging and entertaining setting. We are developing this library using the existing software package Quil, which is written in Clojure. However, Quil’s design is built upon Java Swing, so it focuses on sequences of commands that directly manipulate memory, which goes against the learning objectives of a class that focuses on functional approaches.

We are developing a collection of functions similar to that of the Model-View Control of Racket’s graphical library on top of Quil’s existing library to address the learning objectives of functional programming and hide the imperative approaches currently in Quil. In this system students program using functions that take a state of the system (such as a position of a game character on a board) and return a new state (such as a new position and/or an image representing the character), without direct memory manipulation.

We have designed and developed a collection of functions that abstract over Quil’s direct manipulation of the system’s state so that the state updates and displays using separate functions in a way that is geared toward introductory-level students. In this paper we present the main set of functions and examples of their usage.

Clojure’s integration with Java and usefulness in the work field are just some of the perks that we feel can be beneficial toward students in preparing for their future careers in computer science.  Although Clojure provides many important benefits not seen in Racket, it’s not a language ready for using in an introductory CS course yet. In order to make it a usable language, many steps must be taken in order to accommodate for Clojure’s high learning curves that prevent it from being usable for beginner-level CS students.

One barrier preventing Clojure from being used in an introductory CS course is its error messages. Often, they tend to be unintuitive and unnecessarily long and can be hard to understand for experienced programmers, much less beginning CS students. Also, there is not an environment that supports easy navigation of the error messages and connecting them to their location of the offending line of code (such as highlighting that line of code). Since problem solving is a core learning objective of the introductory course, it is essential for error messages to be usable for beginning students to enable them to easily troubleshoot issues and focus on key learning concepts. So, to solve these issues, we must catch the error messages and throw more user-friendly messages appropriate for introductory CS students.  A graphical interface for displaying these transformed error messages in a development environment is also essential to help students on problem solving and learning key components to functional programming.  

Along with the lack of an appropriate user interface for error messages, there is also an absence of a complete development environment for students to easily program in. The current UMM introductory CS course that uses Racket integrates an IDE called DrRacket that incorporates a user-friendly interface for students to develop programs in, something that is necessary for an introductory CS course.  Currently, there is a development environment that is still in development called Light Table.  Since Light Table was designed for programming in Clojure and was created with usability in mind, it shows promise in usability by which introductory computer science students can program. In order for this program to work however, it needs proper leiningen implementation for students to create projects in before it can be useful for an introductory course.

Another barrier on integrating Clojure for a beginner-level CS course is many methods don’t make sense in the context of their name, or new functionality should be added to ease the transition to functional programming.  For example, in Racket, there are two functions for adding to a collection: add-first and add-last. These two functions make sense in the context of their name and work exactly as they should. In Clojure, you need to first know what kind of collection it is (e.g. a list or sequence) and use the appropriate function to properly add an item to the front or the back of the collection or list. This can potentially be uneasy for students to work with, but with add-first and add last functions where they work as intended disregarding what kind of collection it is, which can make transitioning to understanding programming a simpler process.

\begin{verbatim}         
(add-first 1 [2 3 4]) ;;returns a sequence of [1 2 3 4]
(add-last 4 '(1 2 3)) ;; returns a list of '(1 2 3 4)

(cons 1 [2 3 4])
(conj [1 2 3] 4)
(cons 4 '(1 2 3))
(conj '(2 3 4) 1)
\end{verbatim}

\todo{add an example of a function that should be renamed?}

In order to teach many fundamentals of an introductory CS course, it is crucial that students work with and learn about graphical manipulation. Currently, there is no built in system for graphical functions in Clojure and there is no beginner-friendly graphical library that teaches the learning objectives of functional programming in an introductory CS course. A potential graphical library to use for programming is an open-source project called ‘Quil’ that has many of the functions necessary for students to use in an introductory CS course. However, there are limitations and potential issues to using this graphical library that will steer away from the learning objectives and functional approaches that UMM’s introductory CS curriculum has in place.
